## ðŸŒŸ About Me
Hey! I'm a Ph.D. student in computer science and cognitive science. I work on multimodal physiological systems to better understand how humans make sense of the world, and build AI agents for fun on the side.
I am currently working on update my github with personal and research projects.


## ðŸŽ¯ What I Do
- ðŸ“Š **Statistical Analyses** â€“ Finding insights from data is my jam!
- ðŸ§  **Understanding How Humans Process Information** - Dissertation on using eye tracking and brain data to understand how the eye and brain coordinate to make sense of the world.
- ðŸ¤– **AI Agents** â€“ Using AI agents to improve my workflows and for fun side projects
- ðŸ’» **Software Development** â€“ I am currently improving my software development skills to better integrate my background in bioengineering and cognitive science with my growing skillset in computer science
- 

## ðŸš€ My Tech Stack
- **Languages**: Python, R, SQL
- **Frameworks & Libraries**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, React, Node.js, Langchain


## ðŸ“Œ Featured Projects
ðŸ”¹ **[Eye-Mind Link](#)** â€“ Research using eyetracking, EEG, and fNIRS.<br>
ðŸ”¹ **[Multimodal Gameplay](#)** â€“ How can AI agents use physiological signals and interact while playing video games (be informative AND fun!).<br>
