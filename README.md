## 🦉🧠 About Me 🧪🪐
Hey! I'm a Ph.D. student in computer science and cognitive science at CU Boulder. I work on multimodal physiological systems to better understand how humans make sense of the world, and build AI agents for fun on the side.
I am currently working on updating my github with personal and research projects.


## 🎯 What I Do
- 📊 **Statistical Analyses** – Finding insights from data is a fun puzzle.
- 🧠 **Understanding How Humans Process Information** - Dissertation on using eye tracking and brain data to understand how the eye and brain coordinate to make sense of the world.
- 🤖 **AI Agents** – Using AI agents to improve my workflows and for fun side projects
- 💻 **Software Development** – I am currently improving my software development skills to better integrate my background in bioengineering and cognitive science with my growing skillset in computer science


## 🚀 My Skills
- **Languages**: Python, R, SQL
- **Frameworks & Libraries**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, React, Node.js, Langchain


## 📌 Featured Projects
🔹 **[Eye-Mind Link](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3678957.3685745)** – Research using eyetracking, EEG, and fNIRS.<br>
🔹 **[Multimodal Gameplay](https://github.com/karenlstengel/multimodal-gameplay)** – How can AI agents use physiological signals and interact while playing video games (be informative AND fun!).<br>
